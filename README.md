# ASSESSMENT-2-for-MAST7220

This folder contains all the relevant information / data for the assesment 2 report
I had alot of fun making this and really got into doing, which is why the original full report is X pages long.
However after condensing sections, removing sections, and moving sections to the powerpoing it comes to only X pages long.

In this folder therefore you will find 4 things
  - A folder containing all needed files to run the rmd code
  - A folder containing the Full X page long report with its rmd code
  - a folder containing the condensed X page report with its rmd code
  - A folder containing the accompying powerpoint with its rmd code
